-** Detailed Property View** - Display images, amenities, reviews, and booking form.

- **User Authentication** - Allow users to register, log in, and manage their bookings.

- **Secure Checkout Process** - Simplified payment and confirmation workflow.

- **Favorites and Wishlists** - Enable users to save properties for later.
